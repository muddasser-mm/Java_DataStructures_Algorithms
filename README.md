### Setup
Java enumeration called ProductFact with the constants is defined:
- NAME
- DESCRIPTION
- MANUFACTURER NAME
- MANUFACTURER STREET
- MANUFACTURER CITY
- MANUFACTURER COUNTRY
The Eclipse-Project implements a class TextFinder with a single static method findText. The method takes a Product instance and a string as parameters and returns a ProductFact value. The purpose of the method is to find the given string among the set of string attributes (exact match, not only as a substring!) of the product (and its manufacturer). If the string is found, the method returns the corresponding ProductFact value otherwise, it throws an IllegalArgumentException. Javadoc-compatible comments are added to describe the usage.

## Wx1 - Java basics and Pseudocode
The Eclipse-Project contains two interfaces IBinaryTreeNode and IBinarySearchTree for binary search trees.
a) It implements the Nodeclass BinaryTreeNode, which implements the interface IbinaryTreeNode.
b) It Implements the binary search tree class BinarySearchTree, which implements the Interface IBinary-SearchTree. The duplicates are ignored, which means, when a key value is inserted but already exists in the tree, then nothing happens and the attempt to insert is ignored.

## Wx2 - Stacks and Queues
The Eclipse-Project implements the data structures stack (LIFO) and queue (FIFO) as classes Stack and Queue using the interfaces IStack and IQueue. There is no usage of standard libraries of java.util.Stack and java.util.Queue.

## Wx3 - Binary Search Tree
The Eclipse-Project contains two interfaces IBinaryTreeNode and IBinarySearchTree for binary search trees.
a) It implements the Nodeclass BinaryTreeNode, which implements the interface IbinaryTreeNode.
b) It Implements the binary search tree class BinarySearchTree, which implements the Interface IBinary-SearchTree. The duplicates are ignored, which means, when a key value is inserted but already exists in the tree, then nothing happens and the attempt to insert is ignored.
